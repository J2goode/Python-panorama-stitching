# Python-panorama-stitching
This program is designed to take pictures and stitch them together into one big panorama.

Process:
1. Place files into designated folder
2. The program checks the folder for photos
3. Using opencv, it will identify any points of similarity between the photos, comparing the merged one to the next item on the list
4. If it doesn't identify any similarities, it will say so
5. If it does find any, it'll proceed to merge them together
6. Once it has gone through all of the photos in the folder, it'll say so, and the panorama will be finished.

NEED TO DO:
